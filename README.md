## How it works
The 3D Printed shell houses a full 135ml can of butane which rests in the printed nozzle. The can is actuated by an N20 geared motor and the butane is ignited via a plasma arc in the path of the spray. All of the electronics are code-free and clearly layed out in [Wiring]()

This version has no metal fastners. Just 3d printed links and clever ziptie usage.
